7) Can you overload a method with same return type.? Explain your answer with proper logic.
No
Eg :
static void show(int a,int b)

static void show(int a,int b)

this is not support in java. because of the parameter list of two methods are same

There are two ways to overload the method in java

By changing number of arguments
By changing the data type
